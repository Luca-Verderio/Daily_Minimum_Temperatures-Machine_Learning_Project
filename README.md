# Time Series Forecast: Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne
The goal of the project was to implement a **Deep Neural Network**, using **TensorFlow**, to predict daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne.

This assignment is part of the "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer" course.

## Deep Neural Network Architecture
The model is comprised of a sequential group of layers, as follows:
- Conv1D
- LSTM
- LSTM
- Dense
- Dense
- Dense
- Dense

## Data
The original data set is the following:  
-	[Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne data set](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/blob/master/daily-min-temperatures.csv)

## Tools
Programming language: **Python**  
Python libraries: **TensorFlow**, **NumPy**, **SciPy**  
Environment: **Google Colab Notebook**
